createinitialsquare3D.f90 is a program provided by David that creates the
initial conditions for the square patch test in 3D. It is already set to
generate the 1 Mp cube that we need.

The data in squarepatch3D have 1,000,000 rows and are the following columns:
x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, pressure, interparticle distance, particle volume, mass.

In fact, there is not need to read interparticle distance and mass. They can be
set to 1.d-2 and 1.d0, respectively for all particles.

If working in CGS, do the following unit changes:
smoothing length = 200 * interparticle distance
x = 100 * x
y = 100 * y
z = 100 * z
vx = 100 * vx
vy = 100 * vy
vz = 100 * vz
pressure = 10 * pressure
