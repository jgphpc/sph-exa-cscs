1) install "git-lfs" on your machine
2) in the repository folder, run:
> git lfs install
> git lfs pull

NOTES:
- lfs patterns are in the .gitattributes files
- files that match these patterns are handled by lfs
- everything works as usual, but lfs files are not versioned

Useful commands:

Adding a folder to lfs:
> git lfs track "folder/*"

Checking lfs files before committing:
> git lfs status

List lfs files:
> git lfs ls-files
